            <p>
                If we look at life in the form of a railway… life is like a train. 
                The different stages of life are like the stations we pass through on our journey! 
                Its engine is our <strong>karma</strong>, and the loco-pilot is none other than ourselves. 
                Because it is our karma, the engine, that drives us forward. 
                It is in our hands to decide where we want our train of life to go.
            </p>

            <blockquote>
                "Life’s train never stops for anyone — but every station has a view worth remembering."
            </blockquote>

            <p>
                Yet, even though you are the driver, it is not in your hands to decide who will board your train and who will not. 
                People will come and go. Just as a train does not stop for anyone beyond its scheduled time, 
                life too doesn’t stop for anyone! Because man never stops living.
            </p>

            <p>
                To reach the final station, every station on the way must be crossed. 
                Some stations are loved, while some are not. 
                Sometimes you may not wish to halt, yet you have to, and you must move past that station. 
                And in this journey, sometimes a station touches your heart so deeply that you don’t feel like leaving it… 
                but destiny’s signal says, <em>“Move ahead.”</em>
            </p>

            <p>
                Sometimes you wish that a fellow traveler remains your companion forever, 
                but some tickets are only valid up to a certain station. 
                At some stations, there’s a crowd; at some, you find yourself all alone. 
                But in the end, the only thing in your hands is to keep driving.
            </p>

            <p>
                Where and when the last station will arrive—no one knows. 
                That’s why, cherish the view at every station, relish the beauty of every moment. 
                Because the train of life comes with <strong>no return ticket</strong>.
