        Friendship is a bond unlike any other. It is not defined by blood relations, 
        but it is far stronger and more meaningful. True friendship is when someone 
        casually asks you, “What happened?” and without any hesitation or fear of 
        judgment, you open your heart and share everything. This person becomes your 
        safe space, a rare soul before whom you can be your complete, authentic self, 
        without any masks or pretenses.
      </p>

      <blockquote>"A true friend isn’t just there to celebrate your successes; they stand beside 
                   you during your failures as well."
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        They hold your hand when life gets tough,and they don’t hesitate to point out your mistakes, not to hurt you, but to 
        help you grow. At times, they fiercely defend you and confront anyone who 
        wrongs you, even if it means raising their voice.
      </p>

      <p>
        What makes friendship so precious is the deep understanding that exists without 
        the need for many words. A friend listens not only to what you say but also to 
        what you don’t say, the silence, the pain, the hidden struggles. They are that 
        constant presence in your life, that rightful person who always stands by your 
        side, no matter what.
      </p>

      <p>
        They share your joys and carry your burdens, offering support that feels like 
        a lifeline. Friendship is that unique companionship that completes your life. 
        When a true friend is not around, a quiet thought lingers, “If only I had told 
        them.” A reminder of how much that person truly means to you.
      </p>

      <p>
        Among all people in your life, that one friend is special beyond measure. For 
        such a friend, a lifetime of gratitude still feels like it’s not enough.
