        <h2>Janhavi's Bio</h2>

        <p><strong>Janhavi Giri</strong> has been in love with words since her school days. She first discovered the magic of writing in her 8th grade — when simple poems and short articles became her way of capturing thoughts the heart could feel but the voice couldn’t always say.</p>

        <p>What began as scribbles in notebooks slowly evolved into a deeper creative calling. In 2024, Janhavi took a leap into the professional writing world through her page <em>Vichar Ativichar</em>, a platform where she shares her own thoughts, collaborates with authors and publishers, and connects with readers who find a piece of themselves in her words.</p>

        <p>Her style is rooted in <strong>real-life moments</strong> — sometimes raw, sometimes gentle — but always honest. She writes about situations we all live through: love, loss, hope, resilience, and the quiet truths we often overlook.</p>

        <p>A B.Tech graduate and a working professional, Janhavi proves that passion doesn’t have to wait for the “right time” — it grows alongside every chapter of life. She currently lives in Mumbai, where the city’s pace fuels her dreams, while her hometown <strong>Sambhajinagar, Maharashtra</strong>, remains her anchor and inspiration.</p>

        <p>When she’s not writing, you might find her exploring new books, having long conversations about life, or simply observing the world around her — collecting moments that may one day turn into words.</p>

        <blockquote>
            "For me, writing is not just about telling a story. It’s about holding a mirror to life and letting someone, somewhere, say — this is exactly how I feel."
            <br>— <strong>Janhavi Giri</strong>
