                Sometimes, you just feel like you're constantly running." Like <strong>“Going’s with the flow,”</strong> right? It's just that. 
                But sometimes, you don’t even know where that flow is headed. The same routine, the same faces, the same roads every day.And suddenly, 
                you feel like leaving everything behind and escaping, To a place where there are no expectations, no responsibilities.
            </p>

            <blockquote>
                "In those moments, pause a little. Sit in silence. Just listen to yourself."
            </blockquote>

            <p>
                Gather all your thoughts, tie them up into a bundle. And set them free into the air.
                Take a deep breath. Observe your life closely.
                You’ll realise. it’s not all that bad. 
                We just forget to see its beauty because in all that constant running, we miss the little moments.
            </p>

                Sometimes, that sense of tiredness is a sign, to stop for a bit, to turn around and reflect.
                Sitting still doesn’t mean giving up. It’s the time we gift ourselves to understand who we truly are.
            </p>

            <p>
                Dive deep within, There’s a <em>“you”</em> waiting there, who’s been trying to get your attention for so long.
                Just listen to that voice, once.
            </p>

            <p>
                And then you’ll understand, Why all this is happening. and for whom. 
                That’s when the running will stop. Because you’ll finally find your direction.
